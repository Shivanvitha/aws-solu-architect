tg-can have targets in multiple az or outside the VPC  also

path based routing, content based routing

Access logs contain additional information and are stored in compressed format

health checks are defined at the target group level and many CloudWatch metrics are reported at the target group level

Attaching a target group to an Auto Scaling group enables you to scale each service dynamically based on demand.

IP Address Type

ipv4
The load balancer supports only IPv4 addresses (for example, 192.0.2.1)

dualstack
The load balancer supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses (for example, 2001:0db8:85a3:0:0:8a2e:0370:7334).

Clients that communicate with the load balancer using IPv4 addresses resolve the A record 

clients that communicate with the load balancer using IPv6 addresses resolve the AAAA record.

However, the load balancer communicates with its targets using IPv4 addresses, 
  regardless of how the client communicates with the load balancer. -Note that internal load balancers must use IPv4 addresses.

By default, deletion protection is disabled for your load balancer

The idle timeout value, in seconds. The default is 60 seconds.

Indicates whether HTTP/2 is enabled. The default is true.

You can use AWS WAF with your Application Load Balancer to allow or block requests based on the rules in a web access control list (web ACL).

lb front end conection - closed when idle time out expires -- at least 1 byte of data before each idle timeout period elapses, and increase the length of the idle timeout period as needed.

lb back end conection - enable the HTTP keep-alive option for your EC2 instances.

You can enable HTTP keep-alive in the web server settings for your EC2 instances. If you enable HTTP keep-alive, the load balancer can reuse back-end connections until the keep-alive timeout expires.

 We also recommend that you configure the idle timeout of your application to be larger than the idle timeout configured for the load balancer.
